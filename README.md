# Musician Warmup

Making sure to limber up and get loose before playing your instrument is important for all musicians. This can help prevent injuries.

This web app guides you through a 3.5 minute warmup with an embedded timer and sounds.

This is my first project to use Typescript and Angular.

You can see it hosted here https://richnw.github.io/musician-warmup/
